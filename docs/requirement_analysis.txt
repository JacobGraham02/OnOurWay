Requirement analysis – team 3 Carpool Reservation Service
 
    A registration form (HTML form) is needed for both the web and mobile application.  According to the project requirements, 
there must be an input element which accepts uploaded images (mandatory) for the purpose of user identification and validation. 
Before you are able to register your account, you must choose whether you want to be a driver or passenger; you are able to change your designation 
as a driver or passenger after you have successfully registered your account. Registration set up is different depending on whether you are 
registering as a driver or passenger. 

    The specific information a driver must provide are all of the following: their insurance policy number, driver’s license number, and effective 
and expiration date for their insurance policy and driver’s license. Information a passenger and driver must provide are all of the following: name on credit card, 
credit card number, CVC, and effective and expiration date. They must also provide their contact information including phone number and email address. 

    On the application page, there will be a list of carpools in Barrie with their addresses queried from Google Maps, or retrieved from a database. 
Each driver would handle their own schedule time and the number of people for their vehicle (HTML form). Once a driver has completed the form for their own carpool, 
they must submit the form for validation. After validation, users will be able to reserve a spot in the carpool in the form of a ticket. A success or 
error message will be displayed depending on the status of their registration. 

    By default, the price range for carpools’ tickets are calculated by distance with respect to time because everybody wants to arrive at the destination. 
Drivers initially set the carpool time, number of passengers, and the carpool departure and destination points. Ticket prices for the carpool auto-generates 
based on the distance between the two prior points and gives the driver a price range to choose from. When users are reserving a spot, the price would 
show as whatever the driver chose. Optionally, users can tip the driver after the carpool is finished.

    When the user successfully reserves a spot in a carpool, the ticket for that carpool will be sent to their email, phone, or both, depending on what the 
user chooses. The ticket will be validated at the carpool’s departure to ensure it is valid. 

    For each ticket a user has purchased, a 24-hour cancellation fee is applied and the user is informed of this. 
If the user cancels a carpool ticket anywhere from 24 to 12 hours before the carpool is scheduled to departure, a 20% late fee will be applied to the user. 
Anywhere from 0 to 12 hours before the carpool is scheduled to departure will require the user to pay the original ticket price. 

    A driver is required to wait for 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time if any passenger is not present (they may be late). 
After 15 minutes has passed, it is at the driver’s discretion about whether to wait for the late passenger to show up. 
User payments will go through the backend of our application. After payment is submitted through our application, the payment will be submitted and processed by Stripe.  

JavaScript is our group’s programming language of choice for building this project.
